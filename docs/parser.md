## FireSQL Parser
The FireSQL parser consists of two parts: the lexical scanner and the grammar rule module. Python parser generator [Lark](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is used to provide the lexical scanner and grammar rule to parse the FireSQL statement. In the end, the parser execution generates the parse tree, aka. AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). The complexity of the FireSQL syntax requires an equally complex structure that efficiently stores the information needed for executing every possible FireSQL statement.

For example, the AST parse tree for the FireSQL statement
```sql
SELECT id, date, email
  FROM Bookings
  WHERE date = '2022-04-04T00:00:00'
```

This is delightful to use `lark` due to its design philosophy, which clearly separate the grammar specification from processing. The processing is applied to the parse tree by the Visitor or Transformer components.

### Visitor and Transformer
Visitors and Transformer provide a convenient interface to process the parse-trees that Lark returns. `lark` documentation defines,

* **Visitors** - visit each node of the tree, and run the appropriate method on it according to the node’s data. They work bottom-up, starting with the leaves and ending at the root of the tree.
* **Transformers** -  work bottom-up (or depth-first), starting with visiting the leaves and working their way up until ending at the root of the tree.
  * For each node visited, the transformer will call the appropriate method (callbacks), according to the node’s `data`, and use the returned value to replace the node, thereby creating a new tree structure.
  * Transformers can be used to implement map & reduce patterns. Because nodes are reduced from leaf to root, at any point the callbacks may assume the children have already been transformed.

> Using Visitor is simple at first, but you need to know exactly what you're fetching, the children chain can be difficult to navigate depending on the grammar which produce the parsed tree.

We decided to use Transformer to transform the parse tree to the corresponding SQL component objects that can be easily consumed by the subsequent processing.

For instance, the former example parse tree is transformed into SQL components as,

```
SQL_Select(
  columns=[SQL_ColumnRef(table=None, column='id'),
           SQL_ColumnRef(table=None, column='date'),
           SQL_ColumnRef(table=None, column='email')],
  froms=[SQL_SelectFrom(part='Bookings', alias=None)],
  where=SQL_BinaryExpression(operator='==',
                             left=SQL_ColumnRef(table=None, column='date'),
                             right=SQL_ValueString(value='2022-04-04T00:00:00'))
)
```

With this transformed data structure, we can write the processor walking through the components and produce a execution plan to the corresponding Firestore queries.

## Just Enough SQL for FireSQL
To get going, we don't need the full SQL parser and transformer for the DML (Data Manipulation Language). We define ONLY the `SELECT` statement, just enough for Firestore collections query to serve our immediate needs.

### FireSQL Grammar
A grammar is a formal description of a language that can be used to recognize its structure. The most used format to describe grammars is the **Extended Backus-Naur Form** (EBNF). A typical rules in a Backus-Naur grammar looks like this:

```
  where_clause ::= bool_expression
  bool_expression ::= bool_parentheses
                      | bool_expression "AND" bool_parentheses
                      | bool_expression "OR" bool_parentheses
  bool_parentheses ::= comparison_type
                       | "(" bool_expression "AND" comparison_type ")"
                       | "(" bool_expression "OR" comparison_type ")"
  ...
  CNAME ::= ("_"|"/"|LETTER) ("_"|"/"|LETTER|DIGIT)*
  ...
```

The `where_clause` is usually nonterminal, which means that it can be replaced by the group of elements on the right, `bool_expression`. The element `bool_expression` could contains other nonterminal symbols or terminal ones. Terminal symbols are simply the ones that do not appear as a `<symbol>` anywhere in the grammar and capitalized. A typical example of a terminal symbol is a string of characters, like "(", ")", "AND", "OR", “CNAME”.

### SELECT Statement
By using `lark` [EBNF-like grammar](https://github.com/bennycheung/PyFireSQL/blob/main/firesql/sql/grammar/firesql.lark),
we have encoded the core `SELECT` statement, which is subsequently transformed into Firestore collection queries to be executed.

- SELECT columns for collection field's projection
- FROM sub-clause for collections
- FROM/JOIN sub-clause for joining collections (restricted to 1 join)
- WHERE sub-clause with boolean algebra expression for each collection's queries on field values
  - boolean operators: AND (currently OR is not implemented)
  - operators: =, !=, >, <, <=, >=
  - container expressions: IN, NOT IN
  - array contains expressions: CONTAIN, ANY CONTAIN
  - filter expressions: LIKE, NOT LIKE
  - null expressions: IS NULL, IS NOT NULL
- Aggregation functions applied to the result set
  - COUNT for any field
  - SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX for numeric field

But the processor has the following limitations, which we can provide post-processing on the query results set.
- No ORDER BY sub-clause
- No GROUP BY/HAVING sub-clause
- No WINDOW sub-clause

#### Examples
For example, the following statements can be expressed,
> All keywords are case insensitive. All whitespaces are ignored by the parser.

> `docid` is a special field name to extract the selected document's Id
```sql
  SELECT docid, email, state
    FROM
      Users
    WHERE
      state = 'ACTIVE'
```

> The `*` will select all fields, boolean operator 'AND' to specify multiple query criteria.
```sql
  SELECT *
    FROM
      Users
    WHERE
      state IN ('ACTIVE') AND
      u.email LIKE '%benny%'
```

> The field-subfield can use the `"` to escape the field name with `.` in it.
```sql
  SELECT *
    FROM
      Users as u
    WHERE
      u.state IN ('ACTIVE') AND
      u."location.displayName" = 'Work From Home'
```

> The `JOIN` expression to join 2 collections together
```sql
SELECT u.email, u.state, b.date, b.state
  FROM
    Users as u JOIN Bookings as b
    ON u.email = b.email
  WHERE 
      u.state = 'ACTIVE' AND
      u.email LIKE '%benny%' AND
      b.state IN ('CHECKED_IN', 'CHECKED_OUT') AND
      b.date >= '2022-03-18T04:00:00'
```

> The `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM`, `AVG` are the aggregation functions computed against the result set.
> Only numeric field (e.g. `cost` here) is numeric to have a valid value for `MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM`, `AVG` computation.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), MIN(b.cost), MAX(b.cost), SUM(b.cost), AVG(b.cost)
  FROM
    Users as u JOIN Bookings as b
    ON u.email = b.email
  WHERE 
      u.state = 'ACTIVE' AND
      u.email LIKE '%benny%' AND
      b.state IN ('CHECKED_IN', 'CHECKED_OUT') AND
```
      

> See [firesql.lark](https://github.com/bennycheung/PyFireSQL/blob/main/firesql/sql/grammar/firesql.lark) for the FireSQL grammar specification.

### Collection Path
The Firestore collection has a set of documents. Each document can be nested with more collections. Firestore identifies a collection by a path, looks like `Companies/bennycorp/Users` means `Companies` collection has a document `bennycorp`, which has `Users` collection.

If we want to query a nested collection, we can specify the collection name as a path.
The paths can be long but we can use `AS` keyword to define their alias names.

For example, the subcollection `Users` and `Bookings` are specified with `Companies/bennycorp` document.

```sql
SELECT u.email, u.state, b.date, b.state
  FROM
    Companies/bennycorp/Users as u JOIN Companies/bennycorp/Bookings as b
    ON u.email = b.email
  WHERE 
      u.state = 'ACTIVE' AND
      b.date >= '2022-03-18T04:00:00'
```

> Interesting Firestore Fact: collection path must have odd number of parts.

### DateTime Type
Consistent description of date-time is a big topic that we made a practical design choice.
We are using [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) to express the date-time as a string,
while Firestore stores the date-time as `Timestamp` data type in UTC.
For example,
- writing "March 18, 2022, at time 4 Hours in UTC" date-time string, is "2022-03-18T04:00:00".
- writing "March 18, 2022, at time 0 Hours in Toronto Time EDT (-4 hours)" date-time string, is "2022-03-18T00:00:00-04".

If in doubt, we are using the following to convert, match and render to the ISO-8601 string for date-time values.

```python
DATETIME_ISO_FORMAT = "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"
DATETIME_ISO_FORMAT_REGEX = r'^(-?(?:[1-9][0-9]*)?[0-9]{4})-(1[0-2]|0[1-9])-(3[01]|0[1-9]|[12][0-9])T(2[0-3]|[01][0-9]):([0-5][0-9]):([0-5][0-9])(\.[0-9]+)?(Z|[+-](?:2[0-3]|[01][0-9]):[0-5][0-9])?$'
```

### Pattern Matching by LIKE
The SQL expression `LIKE` or `NOT LIKE` can be used for matching string data.

```sql
SELECT docid, email, state
  FROM
    Users
  WHERE
    state IN ('ACTIVE') AND
    email LIKE '%benny%'
```

After the Firebase query, the pattern matching is used as the filtering expression. The SQL processor supports pattern for:
- prefix match `pattern%`
- suffix match `%pattern`
- infix match `%pattern%`
